<b>Healthy home meals</b> is a web app which enables users to take a picture of their refrigerator, or items over the kitchen top, detects the ingredients present in the picture along with the ones they usually have at home, considers allergies and dietary styles like vegan, lactose-free etc, and recommends healthy recipes that they can make at home. They include detailed step-by-step instructions, youtube video, and other info like cuisine, and cooking time from a dataset of over 5000 IndianÂ recipes.</p>
